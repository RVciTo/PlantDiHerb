      <div class="nickname">Couch Creeper Queen 👑</div>

      <p>Couch Creeper Queen lives for the drama of doing absolutely nothing. She reclines. She trails. She spills out of her pot like she’s fainting in slow motion. She’s the friend who’s always “on the way” but never leaves the house. Needs almost nothing to thrive and still makes your space look like a boho Pinterest board. If plants had Netflix accounts, she’d be the one poking into your profile, watching “Mushrooms: The Silent Drama” under your name and never admitting it.</p>

        <li>Water: Let the top 2–3 cm of soil dry out before watering. She’s not into soggy feet.</li>
        <li>Humidity: Totally fine in normal room vibes, but she’ll thrive if you mist once in a while.</li>
        <li>Feeding: Toss her a little liquid fertilizer every 4–6 weeks in spring/summer. She doesn’t eat much.</li>
        <li>Grooming: Prune leggy vines and wipe her leaves so she keeps that marble glow.</li>

      <div class="nickname">Big Leaf Energy 🍌</div>

      <p>Big Leaf Energy is that guest who shows up in full tropical gear to a chill house party — no one asked, but everyone’s glad he did. He’s dramatic, thirsty, and needs room to sprawl like he owns the balcony. Loves attention, hates dry air, and gets cranky if ignored for more than a day. If this plant could speak, it’d ask for a mist, a spritz of lime, and a playlist called “Jungle Beats & Self-Watering Regrets.”</p>

        <li>Light: Bright indirect light, with a flirtation for morning sun. Too much direct heat = scorched drama.</li>
        <li>Water: Keep soil moist but never soggy. He hates extremes — stay moderate like a chill DJ set.</li>
        <li>Humidity: Yes. All of it. Mist him, steam him, make him feel like he’s in Bali.</li>
        <li>Feeding: Twice a month in spring/summer. He eats like he’s prepping for a tropical bodybuilding competition.</li>
        <li>Grooming: Wipe leaves gently and trim any brown drama. Big leaves, big moods.</li>

        <details><summary>Q: The leaves are turning yellow — what does that mean?</summary><p>A: Could be overwatering or a lack of light. He’s dramatic, not subtle. Let the soil breathe and shift him into the spotlight (indirect, of course).</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: The tips of the leaves are dry and crispy — is that normal?</summary><p>A: Nope, that’s him throwing shade about the humidity. Mist more often or get a humidifier. He’s tropical, remember?</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: Why are the leaves drooping like that?</summary><p>A: He’s parched. Or mad. Either way, water him and give him 30 minutes — he’ll be back and fabulous.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: Why is it leaning toward the window?</summary><p>A: Light-chaser behavior. Rotate him every week so he doesn’t spiral into a banana-side bend.</p></details>

      <p>Cup Queen doesn’t drink from the roots like the others — she sips rainwater from a personal goblet at her center like royalty. She’s tropical, extra, and low-key high-maintenance in the most passive-aggressive way possible. She blooms once, makes a scene, then slowly ghosts you while raising her plant babies. She’s got spiky edges, vibrant colors, and unapologetic “I’m not like other plants” energy.</p>

        <li>Humidity: Loves humidity. Think rainforest, not radiator.</li>
        <li>Feeding: You can use a very diluted fertilizer in the center cup during spring/summer — spa water vibes only.</li>
        <li>Grooming: Snip off faded blooms or browning leaves at the base. She wants to be seen at her best.</li>

        <details><summary>Q: The leaves are turning yellow — what does that mean?</summary><p>A: Could be poor drainage or old age. If it’s just a couple leaves at the base, she’s doing a wardrobe change. If it’s widespread, check the soil — she’s not into soggy bottoms.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: The tips of the leaves are dry and crispy — is that normal?</summary><p>A: Not really. Likely low humidity or stale water in her center cup. Give her cleaner sips and a steamier vibe.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: Why are the leaves drooping like that?</summary><p>A: Could be root stress or a totally dry cup. Top off her tank and mist her ego — she’ll revive if you show her some respect.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: Why is it leaning toward the window?</summary><p>A: That’s her turning toward the drama (a.k.a. the light). Rotate her every week so she stays centered and stunning.</p></details>

      <p>Cha-Ching Chonk is your financially responsible, spiritually chaotic roommate. She’s got a braided trunk like she came straight from a forest spa retreat, and she’s always throwing leafy high-fives from the windowsill. Said to bring luck and coin vibes (but only if you don’t kill her), she’s chill until you overwater her — then she spirals.

One minute she’s standing tall and glowing, the next she’s draped over the pot like she just lost a Grammy. But she always bounces back. She’s the definition of “low effort, high drama.” Cleans your air, blooms when she feels cute, and droops just to remind you she exists.
