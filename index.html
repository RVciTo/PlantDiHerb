        <p>Misty Midnights is your elegant-but-emotional goth plant. Silvery leaves with midnight purple undersides? Yes. Folds up at night like she‚Äôs casting spells? Also yes. She thrives in low light, sulks when the air‚Äôs dry, and needs humidity like your roommate needs incense. She‚Äôs sensitive, particular, and utterly captivating ‚Äî like a moonlit poem trapped in plant form. Handle with care and mist with love.</p>

        <h3>Green Routine</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Light: Low to medium indirect. Think filtered forest floor, not sun-tanning on the balcony.</li>
          <li>Water: Keep the soil consistently lightly moist ‚Äî never soggy. She‚Äôs delicate, not dramatic.</li>
          <li>Humidity: Craves it. Group her with friends, mist daily, or set up a pebble tray altar in her honor.</li>
          <li>Feeding: Light snacks only ‚Äî once a month during growing season.</li>
          <li>Grooming: Gently wipe her leaves and talk softly. She likes attention, but on her terms.</li>
        </ul>

          <div id="cm1" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: Probably too much water or bad drainage. She likes balance, not wet socks. Check the pot and back off the watering.</p></div>
          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm2">Q: The tips of the leaves are dry and crispy ‚Äî is that normal?</button>
          <div id="cm2" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: Very common in dry air. She‚Äôs craving mist or higher humidity ‚Äî give her rainforest energy, not desert.</p></div>
          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm3">Q: Why are the leaves drooping like that?</button>
          <div id="cm3" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: She‚Äôs either thirsty or just woke up ‚Äî she does fold her leaves at night, after all. Check the soil first.</p></div>
          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm4">Q: Why is it leaning toward the window?</button>
          <div id="cm4" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: She‚Äôs reaching for a moodier corner of the light. Rotate her now and then, but don‚Äôt toss her in full sun ‚Äî she‚Äôll ghost you.</p></div>
          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm5">Q: There are dark spots or patches ‚Äî what‚Äôs going on?</button>
          <div id="cm5" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: Could be cold air, crispy vibes, or low humidity drama. Move her somewhere warmer and more humid ‚Äî maybe put on some ambient synths too.</p></div>
