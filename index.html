      <h2>Epipremnum Marble Queen</h2>
      <div class="nickname">Couch Creeper Queen 👑</div>

      <p>Couch Creeper Queen lives for the drama of doing absolutely nothing. She reclines. She trails. She spills out of her pot like she’s fainting in slow motion. She’s the friend who’s always “on the way” but never leaves the house. Needs almost nothing to thrive and still makes your space look like a boho Pinterest board. If plants had Netflix accounts, she’d be the one poking into your profile, watching “Mushrooms: The Silent Drama” under your name and never admitting it.</p>

      <ul class="routine">
        <li>Light: Bright, indirect light. She’s chill in low light too but won’t grow as fast.</li>
        <li>Water: Let the top 2–3 cm of soil dry out before watering. She’s not into soggy feet.</li>
        <li>Humidity: Totally fine in normal room vibes, but she’ll thrive if you mist once in a while.</li>
        <li>Feeding: Toss her a little liquid fertilizer every 4–6 weeks in spring/summer. She doesn’t eat much.</li>
        <li>Grooming: Prune leggy vines and wipe her leaves so she keeps that marble glow.</li>
      </ul>

        <details><summary>Q: My plant’s vines are growing super long but the leaves are getting tiny — what’s up?</summary><p>A: She’s stretching out like a soap opera star with no direction. This means she’s not getting enough light. Move her to a brighter (indirect!) spot and give her a little trim to encourage fuller growth.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: Some leaves have gone full yellow and dropped off — should I worry?</summary><p>A: Nah, if it’s just one or two from the bottom, she’s just shedding old baggage. If it’s happening all over, ease up on the watering — she’s drowning in love.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: My Queen looks faded and pale, like someone drained her mojo.</summary><p>A: That’s a classic low-light slump. She wants light, not a cave. Bright indirect will bring the marbling back to life.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: There are brown patches along the edges — not tips, actual patches.</summary><p>A: Could be a mix of dry air and underwatering. Check her soil and consider giving her a light misting routine or grouping her with other plants to boost humidity.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: Why is she trailing like a couch blanket and not standing up like other plants?</summary><p>A: Because she’s not a stand-up plant, she’s a sprawling legend. But if you want her upright, stake her or use a moss pole — she’ll climb if you give her something to hold onto.</p></details>

      <div class="nickname">Big Leaf Energy 🍌</div>

      <p>Big Leaf Energy is that guest who shows up in full tropical gear to a chill house party — no one asked, but everyone’s glad he did. He’s dramatic, thirsty, and needs room to sprawl like he owns the balcony. Loves attention, hates dry air, and gets cranky if ignored for more than a day. If this plant could speak, it’d ask for a mist, a spritz of lime, and a playlist called “Jungle Beats & Self-Watering Regrets.”</p>

      <ul class="routine">
        <li>Light: Bright indirect light, with a flirtation for morning sun. Too much direct heat = scorched drama.</li>
        <li>Water: Keep soil moist but never soggy. He hates extremes — stay moderate like a chill DJ set.</li>
        <li>Humidity: Yes. All of it. Mist him, steam him, make him feel like he’s in Bali.</li>
        <li>Feeding: Twice a month in spring/summer. He eats like he’s prepping for a tropical bodybuilding competition.</li>
        <li>Grooming: Wipe leaves gently and trim any brown drama. Big leaves, big moods.</li>

      <details><summary>Q: The edges of the leaves are brown and dry — what did I do?</summary><p>A: That's Banana Boi begging for humidity. He’s tropical, remember? Dry air makes him crispy. Mist him or set him up with a humidity tray.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: The leaves are splitting down the middle — is he okay?</summary><p>A: Totally normal. His big dramatic leaves are fragile. Splits happen from movement or low humidity — not a health issue, just his wild style.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: Why is there a weird sticky residue on the leaves?</summary><p>A: That’s called guttation — basically banana sweat. Totally normal if he’s well watered and hydrated. Just wipe it off gently with a damp cloth.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: Some lower leaves turned yellow and flopped — should I cut them?</summary><p>A: Yep, prune them. Old leaves die off as new ones grow. Unless all the leaves are going yellow, it’s just him refreshing his wardrobe.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: Why is he leaning so hard toward the window?</summary><p>A: He’s chasing that golden glow. Rotate him weekly or he’ll get lopsided like a sun-thirsty yoga instructor.</p></details>

      <p>Cup Queen doesn’t drink from the roots like the others — she sips rainwater from a personal goblet at her center like royalty. She’s tropical, extra, and low-key high-maintenance in the most passive-aggressive way possible. She blooms once, makes a scene, then slowly ghosts you while raising her plant babies. She’s got spiky edges, vibrant colors, and unapologetic “I’m not like other plants” energy.</p>

        <li>Humidity: Loves humidity. Think rainforest, not radiator.</li>
        <li>Feeding: You can use a very diluted fertilizer in the center cup during spring/summer — spa water vibes only.</li>
        <li>Grooming: Snip off faded blooms or browning leaves at the base. She wants to be seen at her best.</li>

      <details><summary>Q: The center of my plant is turning brown — is she dying?</summary><p>A: Kinda, yeah — but in a fabulous way. Bromeliads bloom once and then fade like a diva’s farewell tour. She’ll start growing pups at the base. Celebrate the legacy.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: There’s water in the middle and it smells... funky?</summary><p>A: Her royal goblet needs cleaning. Dump out the old water and refill with fresh every week or so. Stagnant water = drama.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: Why are the leaf tips turning brown and crunchy?</summary><p>A: Low humidity or hard water. Mist her occasionally and switch to filtered or rainwater if you can. She’s fancy like that.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: My Queen's leaves are fading — less vibrant than before.</summary><p>A: She might be past her blooming peak or craving more indirect light. Don’t put her in direct sun — she burns faster than gossip.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: What are these tiny plants growing at the base?</summary><p>A: Those are her pups! You can let them grow attached or separate them once they’re a few inches tall. She’s leaving you a legacy.</p></details>

      <p>Cha-Ching Chonk is your financially responsible, spiritually chaotic roommate. She’s got a braided trunk like she came straight from a forest spa retreat, and she’s always throwing leafy high-fives from the windowsill. Said to bring luck and coin vibes (but only if you don’t kill her), she’s chill until you overwater her — then she spirals.

      <details><summary>Q: The leaves have brown tips — am I being stingy with something?</summary><p>A: Probably humidity. She prefers tropical vibes, not dry apartments. Mist her occasionally or bring her near your plant gang to boost the mood.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: Why is the trunk going soft or mushy?</summary><p>A: 🚨 That’s a rot alert. Too much water or trapped moisture. Repot immediately if it’s spreading, and make sure her pot drains like a fiscally responsible adult.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: She’s growing tall but looks awkward — what gives?</summary><p>A: That’s light hunger. She’s stretching out and losing her compact charm. Move her to a brighter spot and rotate regularly to keep her growing evenly.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: The leaves have weird spots — help?</summary><p>A: Could be mineral buildup from tap water or inconsistent watering. Flush the soil occasionally and try filtered water if she’s being sensitive.</p></details>

One minute she’s standing tall and glowing, the next she’s draped over the pot like she just lost a Grammy. But she always bounces back. She’s the definition of “low effort, high drama.” Cleans your air, blooms when she feels cute, and droops just to remind you she exists.

      <details><summary>Q: There are dark patches near the base of the leaves — should I worry?</summary><p>A: If it’s spreading or mushy, yep. Could be root rot or fungal drama. Improve airflow, check the soil, and don’t mist directly at night.</p></details>
