She‚Äôs the friend who‚Äôs always ‚Äúon the way‚Äù but never leaves the house. Needs almost nothing to thrive and still makes your space look like a boho Pinterest board. If plants had Netflix accounts, she‚Äôd be the one poking into your profile, watching ‚ÄúMushrooms: The Silent Drama‚Äù under your name and never admitting it.</p>

        <details><summary>Q: Some leaves have gone full yellow and dropped off ‚Äî should I worry?</summary><p>A: Nah, if it‚Äôs just one or two from the bottom, she‚Äôs just shedding old baggage. If it‚Äôs happening all over, ease up on the watering ‚Äî she‚Äôs drowning in love.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: My Queen looks faded and pale, like someone drained her mojo.</summary><p>A: That‚Äôs a classic low-light slump. She wants light, not a cave. Bright indirect will bring the marbling back to life.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: There are brown patches along the edges ‚Äî not tips, actual patches.</summary><p>A: Could be a mix of dry air and underwatering. Check her soil and consider giving her a light misting routine or grouping her with other plants to boost humidity.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Q: Why is she trailing like a couch blanket and not standing up like other plants?</summary><p>A: Because she‚Äôs not a stand-up plant, she‚Äôs a sprawling legend.

He‚Äôs dramatic, thirsty, and needs room to sprawl like he owns the balcony. Loves attention, hates dry air, and gets cranky if ignored for more than a day.

        <li>Humidity: Yes. All of it. Mist him, steam him, make him feel like he‚Äôs in Bali.</li>
        <li>Feeding: Twice a month in spring/summer. He eats like he‚Äôs prepping for a tropical bodybuilding competition.</li>

      <details><summary>Q: The leaves are splitting down the middle ‚Äî is he okay?</summary><p>A: Totally normal. His big dramatic leaves are fragile. Splits happen from movement or low humidity ‚Äî not a health issue, just his wild style.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: Why is there a weird sticky residue on the leaves?</summary><p>A: That‚Äôs called guttation ‚Äî basically banana sweat. Totally normal if he‚Äôs well watered and hydrated. Just wipe it off gently with a damp cloth.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: Some lower leaves turned yellow and flopped ‚Äî should I cut them?</summary><p>A: Yep, prune them. Old leaves die off as new ones grow. Unless all the leaves are going yellow, it‚Äôs just him refreshing his wardrobe.</p></details>

      <details><summary>Q: The leaf edges are crispy and brown ‚Äî is she mad at me?</summary><p>A: Just dehydrated and dramatic. Low humidity is her mortal enemy. Mist daily or set her near a humidifier and apologize with soft ambient music.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: The leaves curl up during the day and relax at night ‚Äî is that normal?</summary><p>A: Yes! She‚Äôs a prayer plant, not a weirdo. That‚Äôs just her circadian rhythm doing its thing. No exorcism needed.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: She has yellow leaves and looks miserable ‚Äî what‚Äôs wrong?</summary><p>A: Probably soggy feet. Overwatering or poor drainage will kill her vibe fast. Let the soil get lightly moist ‚Äî not soaked.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: Her color looks faded ‚Äî what happened to her silver shimmer?</summary><p>A: Too much direct light can wash her out. Move her to a shadier bright spot ‚Äî think forest, not beach.</p></details>
      <details><summary>Q: There are dark patches near the base of the leaves ‚Äî should I worry?</summary><p>A: If it‚Äôs spreading or mushy, yep. Could be root rot or fungal drama. Improve airflow, check the soil, and don‚Äôt mist directly at night.</p></details>
