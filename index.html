She’s the friend who’s always “on the way” but never leaves the house. Needs almost nothing to thrive and still makes your space look like a boho Pinterest board. If plants had Netflix accounts, she’d be the one poking into your profile, watching “Mushrooms: The Silent Drama” under your name and never admitting it.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Light: Low to medium indirect. Think filtered forest floor, not sun-tanning on the balcony.</li>
          <li>Water: Keep the soil consistently lightly moist — never soggy. She’s delicate, not dramatic.</li>
          <li>Humidity: Craves it. Group her with friends, mist daily, or set up a pebble tray altar in her honor.</li>
          <li>Feeding: Light snacks only — once a month during growing season.</li>
          <li>Grooming: Gently wipe her leaves and talk softly. She likes attention, but on her terms.</li>
        </ul>

          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm1">Q: The leaves are turning yellow — what does that mean?</button>
          <div id="cm1" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: Probably too much water or bad drainage. She likes balance, not wet socks. Check the pot and back off the watering.</p></div>
          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm2">Q: The tips of the leaves are dry and crispy — is that normal?</button>
          <div id="cm2" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: Very common in dry air. She’s craving mist or higher humidity — give her rainforest energy, not desert.</p></div>
          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm3">Q: Why are the leaves drooping like that?</button>
          <div id="cm3" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: She’s either thirsty or just woke up — she does fold her leaves at night, after all. Check the soil first.</p></div>
          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm4">Q: Why is it leaning toward the window?</button>
          <div id="cm4" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: She’s reaching for a moodier corner of the light. Rotate her now and then, but don’t toss her in full sun — she’ll ghost you.</p></div>
          <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cm5">Q: There are dark spots or patches — what’s going on?</button>
          <div id="cm5" class="panel" aria-hidden="true"><p>A: Could be cold air, crispy vibes, or low humidity drama. Move her somewhere warmer and more humid — maybe put on some ambient synths too.</p></div>
